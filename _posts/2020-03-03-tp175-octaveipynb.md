for interest I like to explore these documentation tools across programming languages, so for as for my R stuff I did the same for Octave.

I set out to do this with Anaconda for Jupyter, and knitr for markdown. Both require independent Octave installation.

Anaconda
conda create -n my-o-env
conda install -c conda-forge octave_kernel
