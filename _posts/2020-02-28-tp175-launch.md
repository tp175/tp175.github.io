This weekend, I got motivated to create that <code>username.github.io</code> repository required for <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. 
In case you're unaware, <b>GitHub</b> offers a free hosting service (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for projects, organisations, users.
Neat examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples" target="_blank">here</a>.
 
As I've been looking to host some stuff online, I found a tutorial - <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages" target="_blank">Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</a> - and got going.
Being familar with <b>Git</b>, initialization was relatively straightforward and intuitive - including directory/file structure. 
Installation of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for Windows, to test/preview locally, was about as convoluted as it got.
The rest of the time was spent brushing up on HTML & CSS. 

Et viola, I finally have a home to host that cool <b>markdown</b> I've been playing with ( next post ). <br>
Check out this <a href="http://annaken.github.io/intro_to_git_course/" target="_blank">example</a> in the meantime on <b>Git</b>.
